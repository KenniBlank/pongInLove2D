# pongInLove2D

> This is the first and probably last version of the pong game that I have developed in love2d with the help of lua programming language

> You will find a folder WINDOWS where if you are on windows, you can simply open the PONG.exe file. It's not a virus just press run anyways. You can sue me if else.

> Additionally there is a simple PONG.love file which you can open with love2d engine in every OS.

> If you need it, there is additional folder called source which has everything that I have built the game on.
